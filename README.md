# Buhay

> Bawat araw, mas malinaw. Every day, clearer.

- History with search, filters, sorting, and inline editing.

## Tala Mind And Life Admin

- Today check-in with mood, energy, stress, sleep quality, priority, gratitude, and reflection.

- Insights for journal streaks, mood averages, energy trends, task completion, top tags, and common triggers.
- Tala settings for reminder time, weekly review day, prompt style, journal privacy default, mood insight visibility, export, and Tala-only data deletion.
- Clear disclaimer behavior: Tala is for tracking/reflection, not diagnosis or medical/mental-health advice.

## Privacy And Safety

- Per-user Firestore data under `users/{uid}`.
- Firestore rules restrict user data to the authenticated owner.
- Firebase Storage rules should restrict user images to the authenticated owner.
- Privacy mode masks sensitive money and personal values across app views.
- Receipt, import, command, meal, workout, task, and goal flows use review-before-save behavior where relevant.
- JSON backups include app data and image metadata links, but image files are not re-uploaded from backups.
- Account deletion and data reset tools are available in Settings.
- Legal pages explain privacy, terms, third-party services, OCR/import behavior, and product limits.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Auth: Firebase Authentication, Email/Password
- Database: Firestore, real-time per-user collections
- Storage: Firebase Storage for receipt, meal, and body progress images
- Hosting: Vercel
- PWA: Installable web app with service worker caching
- OCR/import: OCR.Space for receipt, wallet screenshot, and image-assisted parsing when enabled

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <your-buhay-repo-url>
cd <your-buhay-folder>
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Fill in Firebase and OCR values in `.env.local`.

## Environment Variables

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
VITE_OCR_SPACE_API_KEY=your_ocr_space_api_key
```

`VITE_OCR_SPACE_API_KEY` is optional, but recommended for receipt, wallet screenshot, and image-assisted import features.

## Deploy Firestore And Storage Rules

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
```

## Deploy To Vercel

1. Push to GitHub.
2. Import the repo into Vercel.
3. Add all `VITE_FIREBASE_*` environment variables in Vercel project settings.
4. Add `VITE_OCR_SPACE_API_KEY` if OCR import should be enabled in production.
5. Deploy.
6. Add the Vercel domain to Firebase Console > Authentication > Authorized domains.

## PWA Install

1. Open the deployed URL in Chrome on Android or Safari on iOS.
2. Android: tap the browser menu, then Add to Home Screen.
3. iOS: tap Share, then Add to Home Screen.
4. Buhay caches the app shell and static assets for installed-app launches, while Firebase/Auth/API requests stay network-only for safety.

## Release Checklist

Run before pushing a production deploy:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Manual QA:

- Auth: sign up, log in, log out, remember-me, password reset, and email verification banner.
- Onboarding: currency, opening balances, recurring bills, bill pay-from account, and optional Lakas/Tala starter paths.
- Takda: dashboard, quick add, calendar selected-day detail, accounts, history, savings, bills, budget, breakdown, receipts, grocery mode, and Ask Takda confirmation.
- Bills/receipts trust check: marking a bill paid should create only one expense when enabled; receipt-only saves should not move balances; receipt+expense saves should clearly show account impact.
- Lakas: beginner recommendation, Gym Session start, muted in-session YouTube autoplay, warm-up, set tracker, rest timer, next exercise, save workout, meal photo log, body log, activity, habits, goals, and settings/logout.
- Tala: today check-in, calm plan, journal prompts/privacy masking, mood trends, tasks done/reopen, goals, calendar selected-day detail, insights, and settings/logout.
- PWA: install on iOS Safari and Android Chrome, launch from home screen, navigate while offline, then reconnect and verify Firebase-backed data refreshes.
- Firebase/Vercel: Firestore rules, Storage rules, Firebase Auth authorized domains, Vercel environment variables, OCR key if enabled, and service worker cache version.

```

## Notes

- The public landing page lives at `/`.
- Auth lives at `/login`.
- The signed-in app lives at `/app`.
- The whole product is named Buhay.
- The finance space inside Buhay is still named Takda.
- Ask Takda is intentionally finance-focused for now.
- Google Sign-In is not enabled in the active auth screen.
- OCR import depends on `VITE_OCR_SPACE_API_KEY` when cloud OCR is enabled.
- JSON backup/restore covers Takda, Lakas, Tala, profile settings, and metadata links for images.
- Build verification requires Node/npm. If this environment has no Node/npm installed, `npm run build` cannot run.
